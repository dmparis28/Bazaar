ðŸš€ Getting Started

Install pnpm:
If you don't have it, install it globally:

npm install -g pnpm


Install Dependencies:
From this root directory, run:

pnpm install


This will install all the dependencies for all the projects defined in the pnpm-workspace.yaml file.

Start Developing:
You can now run commands for individual projects from the root. For example, to start the Next.js frontend (once it's set up):

pnpm --filter frontend dev
